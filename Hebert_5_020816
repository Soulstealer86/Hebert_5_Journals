Describe - What is an array?
An arrangement of code

How might you use JavaScript arrays together with random? 
You could make a random array, I suppose. 
Unfortunately with computers there is no such thing as random, it's all an algorithm.
Someone should fix that soon.

Or for other webpage purposes?
It's like a very powerful sock drawer, if you didn't have it, and instead had multiple containers for each different type of sock, it would be a nightmare,
so it holds them all.
