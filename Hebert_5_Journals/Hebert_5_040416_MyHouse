Please describe the process you used to complete your house.
I made a gradient, a square, and a triangle.

Most of you were very successful at creating the house - What were the behaviors leading to success? 
{Note - behaviors describe things people do - not imagining internal states}
I'm not most people, unfortunately, mine sucked.
