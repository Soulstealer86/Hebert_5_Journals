The Devil Within

I will keep quiet
You won't even know I'm here
You won't suspect a thing
You won't see me in the mirror
But I crept into your heart
You can't make me disappear
Til I make you
I made myself at home
In the cobwebs and the lies
I'm learning all your tricks
I can hurt you from inside
Oh I made myself a promise
You would never see me cry
Til I make you
You'll never know what hit you
Won't see me closing in
I'm gonna make you suffer
This Hell you put me in
I'm underneath your skin
You'll never know what hit you
I will be here
When you think you're all alone
Seeping through the cracks
I'm the poison in your bones
My love is your disease
I won't let it set you free
Til I break you
I tried to be the lover to your nightmare
Look what you made of me
Now I'm the heavy burden that you can't bear
Look what you made of me
Look what you made of me
I'll make you see
You'll never know what hit you
Won't see me closing in
I'm gonna make you suffer
This Hell you put me in
I'm underneath your skin
You'll never know what hit you

Where the Lonely Ones Roam

Won't you come out we can paint the town red.
Kill a little time you can sleep when you are dead.
Cause it isn't over yet,
get it outta your head.
Chase a couple hearts we could leave em in shreds. 
Meet me in the gutter make the devil your friend.
Just remember what I said, cause it isn't over yet.
Just remember what I said, cause it isn't over yet.

CHORUS 
Say you have a little faith in me,
just close your eyes and let me lead,
follow me home.
Need to have a little trust in me,
just close your eyes and let me lead,
follow me home, to where the lonely ones roam.

Won't you come out I've been waiting for you,
holding my breath til my body turned blue.
We got everything to lose, yeah I'm waiting on you.
Suns come up and there's no one else around, 
meet me in the shadows while you tell me what you 
found.
You got everything to lose, yeah I'm waiting on you.

CHORUS
Say you have a little faith in me,
just close your eyes and let me lead,
follow me home.
Need to have a little trust in me,
just close your eyes and let me lead,
follow me home, to where the lonely ones roam.
To where the lonely ones roam.

Roam with me, come down to where all the others fell,
Get lost in the dark to find yourself.
Just remember what I said, 
no it isn't over yet.

CHORUS
Say you have a little faith in me,
just close your eyes and let me lead,
follow me home.
Need to have a little trust in me,
just close your eyes and let me lead,
follow me home, to where the lonely ones roam.
To where the lonely ones roam.

Need to have a little trust in me,
just close your eyes and let me lead,
follow me home, to where the lonely ones roam.

IB Bad Apple

Ever on and on I continue circling
With nothing but my hate in a carousel of agony
Till slowly I forget and my heart starts vanishing
And suddenly I see that I can't break free--I'm
Slipping through the cracks of a dark eternity
With nothing but my pain and the paralyzing agony
To tell me who I am, who I was
Uncertainty enveloping my mind
Till I can't break free, and

Maybe it's a dream; maybe nothing else is real
But it wouldn't mean a thing if I told you how I feel
So I'm tired of all the pain, of the misery inside
And I wish that I could live feeling nothing but the
night
You can tell me what to say; you can tell me where to
go
But I doubt that I would care, and my heart would never
know
If I make another move,there'll be no more turning back
Because everything will change, and it all will fade to
black

Will tomorrow ever come? Will I make it through the
night?
Will there ever be a place for the broken in the light?
Am I hurting? Am I sad? Should I stay, or should I go?
I've forgotten how to tell. Did I ever even know?
Can I take another step? I've done everything I can
All the people that I see I will never understand
If I find a way to change, if I step into the light
Then I'll never be the same, and it all will fade to
white

Ever on and on I continue circling
With nothing but my hate in a carousel of agony
Till slowly I forget and my heart starts vanishing
And suddenly I see that I can't break free--I'm
Slipping through the cracks of a dark eternity
With nothing but my pain and the paralyzing agony
To tell me who I am, who I was
Uncertainty enveloping my mind
Till I can't break free, and

Maybe it's a dream; maybe nothing else is real
But it wouldn't mean a thing if I told you how I feel
So I'm tired of all the pain, of the misery inside
And I wish that I could live feeling nothing but the
night
You can tell me what to say; you can tell me where to
go
But I doubt that I would care, and my heart would never
know
If I make another move there'll be no more turning back
Because everything will change, and it all will fade to
black

If I make another move, if I take another step
Then it all would fall apart. There'd be nothing of me
left
If I'm crying in the wind, if I'm crying in the night
Will there ever be a way? Will my heart return to
white?
Can you tell me who you are? Can you tell me where I
am?
I've forgotten how to see; I've forgotten if I can
If I opened up my eyes there'd be no more going back,
Because I'd throw it all away, and it all would fade to
black

Awoken

[Verse 1]
What cause have I to feel glad?
I've built my life on judgment and causing pain.
I don't know those eyes I see in the bloodstained chrome
Now everything that I've had and everything I've known have been thrown away.
And with time I've come to find this isn't my home

[Chorus 1]
I've stroked the fire, seen more pain that you can know
The tears of the broken have washed away my soul
Pushed by desire to change the way my stream will flow
Now I've awoken, and I'm taking back control!

[Chorus 2]
I try my best to block out the screams.
But they're haunting me in my dreams
Please break my shackles,�?�I want it to stop

[Verse 2]
I man these wretched machines
Day in, day out, the grinding wears on my brain,
Undermining my sanity, making me question my reality,
But life is not as it seems
Should I take a chance of freedom and throw it all down the drain?
I've been imprisoned, please burn my transgressions away

[Chorus Part 1]
I've stroked the fire, seen more pain that you can know
The tears of the broken have washed away my soul
Pushed by desire to change the way my stream will flow
Now I've awoken, and I'm taking back control!

[Chorus 2]
I try my best to block out the screams.
But they're haunting me in my dreams
Please break my shackles,�?�I want it to stop

[Chorus 1]
I've stroked the fire, seen more pain that you can know
The tears of the broken have washed away my soul
Pushed by desire to change the way my stream will flow
Now I've awoken, and I'm taking back control!

[Chorus 1.5]
I'm sick of hurting, sick of thinking it's all I do,
I break those around me, those spared are very few,
But the, bright sun is burning, and my sky shines ever blue,
Friendships surround me, I'm becoming a part of you

[Chorus 2]
I try my best to block out the screams.
But they're haunting me in my dreams
Please break my shackles,�?�I want it to stop

Rainbow Factory

Now a rainbow's tale isn't quite as nice
As the story we knew of sugar and spice
But a rainbow's easy once you get to know it
With the help of the magic of a pegasus device

Let's delve deeper into rainbow philosophy
Far beyond that of Cloudsdale's mythology
It's easy to misjudge that floating city
With it's alluring decor and social psychology
But with all great things comes a great responsibility
That of Cloudsdale's being weather stability
How, you ask, are they up to the task
To which the answer is in a simple facility

In the Rainbow Factory, where your fears and horrors come true
In the Rainbow Factory, where not a single soul gets through
In the Rainbow Factory, where your fears and horrors come true

(Instrumental)

In the Rainbow Factory, where your fears and horrors come true
In the Rainbow Factory, where not a single soul gets through
In the Rainbow Factory, where your fears and horrors come true
In the Rainbow Factory, where not a single soul gets through

6 Billion Years And Overnight Story

Once a upon a time and place unknown
Lived a boy forgot and left all alone
No one knew what he could do or of this fairytale

Probably since before the day I was born
Call it fate but I was drowned with scorn
No one tried to be on my side so I'd turn the other cheek

I can't help my feeling sad
Though I guess it ain't too bad
Calling from the setting sun
Took my hand and flew away

Tell me why Tell me why
No one ever tells me why
Why they hate me and despise me when I haven't done a thing
In the rain all I feel is this never ending chill
But a trillion trillion trillion years had left me freezing cold

Can I die? Can I die?
I'm just waiting 'til I die
Never dreamed a single dream so kind in my entire life
No one knew, even cared for this fleeting fairy tail
Then it slipped into seething sun and soon it sailed away

All this time it bore right down to the core
All the pain had torn and left me sore
Right behind you had all this time been watching from my side

Cannot look or hear or speak to me
But you did "Your name, will you tell me it please?"
I can't give and I wish I did
But I just don't have the tongue

Crave a home I've never had
Though I guess it ain't too bad
"Let's just leave and go back home"
Take my hand and fly away

Tell me why Tell me why
No one ever tells me why
Why you think you're just a kid when you can do so many things
On my own never known of this light leading me home
But a trillion trillion trillion years had taught me I'm alone

"Can I try? Can I try?"
"Never know until I try"
But they'll kill you if they see you trying now to save my life
In the rain all we feel is this never ending chill
But we'll slip into the seething sun and soon we'll sail away

Day is done now and soon the dawn will break
Play 'til we drop so that we'll never have to wake
What if this place was made of only me and you?
If just the world and everyone would all go away
If just the world and everyone would all go away

Tell me why Tell me why
A small voice will tell me why
No it's not the voice of you or I but
ALL MAN KIND
Can't resist, we'll be missed That's a lie but I insist
That we'll slip into the seething sun and soon we'll sail away

Tell me why Tell me why
Though you answer to me "why?"
What's your name and where're we going? But hell that's the fun of life!
In the rain I don't care just as long as you are there
'Cause a trillion trillion trillion years had left me thinking clear

Tell me why, tell me dear
There's ringing in my ear

Then we slipped into the seething sun and finally sailed away!

Game of Life

My first life was so boring, just forget I mentioned it 
And my second seemed to let me do all of the things my first life didn't 
Third life was a hateful man all poison to the bone In my fourth, 
I played piano but just didn't have the eyes to read the notes  
In my fifth life, I supported girls- of course, that wasn't all 
My sixth life was corrupted though I guess it was a little fun 
Seventh life I cried so much and all I did was mourn 
In my eigth life, was so rich I could've bought the world and everything  

In this life is a game played by a flaky God He gambles every life 
Try to escape but you know the path you're on is game and set  
See how the game of life is playing all of us for fools 
Dancing a string around us, making all these silly rules See how he looks down on us like we're acting out a show 
Throw the dice and let's see which head will roll...  

By nine, I drew some manga but the deadlines left me dead 
My tenth life was a teacher, as a pedo*****;I worked part time 
Next life, what, eleven? 
Sorry I try to forget... Never could describe how awful- no, 
I'm terrified to think of all  
The things that such a die can do, kinda crazy 

Deciding everyday 
Try to escape but the days repeat and keep you here to stay  
See how the game of life is never won, you only play 
Bore him and you will find you're crumpled up and thrown away 
Clinging to fate and blaming it when life won't go your way Such a laugh, ha! 
Life is just a game  

Cry out all your eyes or win a new fortune 
The chance is one out of six Try to escape 
Why not try your luck and see what you may get?  
See how the game of life is playing all of us for fools 
Dancing a string around us, making all these silly rules See how he looks down on us like we're acting out a show 
Throw the dice and let's see which head will roll...

Sickly grinning downward, tosses out a pair of dice Cheating away around the board,
"Ah, this is paradise."
People praying on their knees but no one there to hear
Ah, look down at all the puppets here
Ah, look up at all the puppeteers. 

I need a doctor

[Chorus - Skylar Grey:]
I'm about to lose my mind
You’ve been gone for so long, I’m runnin' outta time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life

[Eminem:]
I told the world one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it so that one day I could play it back
But I don’t even know if I believe it when I’m sayin' that
Doubts startin' to creep in, every day it's just so grey and black
Hope, I just need a ray of that, 'cause no one sees my vision
When I play it for ‘em, they just say it's wack, but they don’t know what dope is
And I don’t know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
But for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son, demons fighting you, it’s dark
Let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you
I don't think you realize what you mean to me, not the slightest clue
'Cause me and you were like a crew, I was like your sidekick
You gon' either wanna fight when I get off this fuckin' mic
Or you gon' hug me, but I'm outta options, there's nothin' else I can do 'cause

[Chorus - Skylar Grey:]
I'm about to lose my mind
You’ve been gone for so long, I’m runnin' outta time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life

[Eminem:]
It hurts when I see you struggle, you come to me with ideas
You say they're just pieces, so I’m puzzled, 'Cause the shit I hear is crazy
But you're either gettin' lazy or you don’t believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
Can't make a decision you keep questionin' yourself
Second guessin' and it's almost like your beggin' for my help
Like I’m your leader, you're supposed to fuckin' be my mentor
I can endure no more I demand you remember who you are
It was YOU, who believed in me when everyone was tellin'
You don't sign me, everyone at the fuckin' label, let's tell the truth
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy, Dre, I’m cryin' in this booth
You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I ain't givin' up faith and you ain't givin' up on me
Get up Dre I'm dyin', I need you, come back for fuck’s sake, 'cause

[Chorus - Skylar Grey:]
I'm about to lose my mind
You’ve been gone for so long, I’m runnin' outta time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
Bring me back to life

(I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life)

[Dr Dre:]
It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday, though
You walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room, cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoke
Went through friends, some of them I put on, but they just left
They said they was ridin' to the death, but where the fuck are they now?
Now that I need them, I don't see none of them
All I see is Slim, fuck all you fair-weather friends, all I need is him
Fuckin' backstabbers, when the chips were down you just laughed at us
Now you bout to feel the fuckin' wrath of Aftermath, faggots
You gon' see us in our lab jackets and ask us where the fuck we been?
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots
And the crackers' ass, little cracker jack beat
Makin' wack math, backwards producers, I'm back bastards
One more CD and then I’m packin' up my bags and as I’m leavin'
I’ll guarantee they scream, "Dre, don’t leave us like that man!" 'cause

[Chorus - Skylar Grey:]
I'm about to lose my mind
You’ve been gone for so long, I’m runnin' outta time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life 

FNAF

[Verse 1:]
We're waiting every night
To finally roam and invite
Newcomers to play with us
For many years we've been here all alone

We're forced to be still and play
The same songs we've known since that day
An imposter took our life away
Now we're stuck here to decay

[Pre-Chorus:]
Please let us get in!
Don't lock us away!
We're not like what you're thinking

We're poor little souls
Before we've lost all control
And we're forced here to take that role

We've been all alone
Stuck in our little zone
Since 1987

Join us, be our friend
Or just be stuck and defend
After all you only got

[Chorus x2:]
Five Nights at Freddy's
Is this where you want to be
I just don't get it
Why do you want to stay

Five Nights at Freddy's

[Verse 2:]
We're really quite surprised
We get to see you another night
You should have looked for another job
You should have said to this place good-bye

It's like there's so much more
Maybe you've been in this place before
We remember a face like yours
You seem acquainted with those doors

[Pre-Chorus:]
Please let us get in!
Don't lock us away!
We're not like what you're thinking

We're poor little souls
Who have lost all control
And we're forced here to take that role

We've been all alone
Stuck in our little zone
Since 1987

Join us, be our friend
Or just be stuck and defend
After all you only got

[Chorus x2:]
Five Nights at Freddy's
Is this where you want to be
I just don't get it
Why do you want to stay

Five Nights at Freddy's 

FNAF2

[Verse 1:]
I dunno what I was thinking,
Leaving my child behind,
Now I suffer the curse and now I am blind

With all this anger, guilt and sadness,
Coming to haunt me forever,
I can't wait for the cliff at the end of the river,

Is this revenge I am seeking,
Or seeking someone to avange me
Stuck in my own paradox I wanna set myself free

Maybe I should chase and find
Before they'll try to stop it
It won't be long before I'll become a puppet

[Chorus:]
It's been so long,
Since I last have seen my son
Lost to this monster
To the man behind the slaughter

Since you've been gone
I've been singing this stupid song
So I could ponder
The sanity of your mother

[Verse 2:]
I wish I lived in the present
With the gift of my past mistakes
But the future keeps luring in like a pack of snakes

Your sweet little eyes, your little smile,
Is all I remember
Those fuzzy memories mess with my temper

Justification is killing me
But killing isn't justified
What happened to my son, I'm terrified

It lingers in my mind and the thought keeps on getting bigger,
I'm sorry my sweet baby, I wish I've been there.

[Chorus:]
It's been so long,
Since I last have seen my son
Lost to this monster
To the man behind the slaughter

Since you've been gone
I've been singing this stupid song
So I could ponder
The sanity of your mother

FNAF3

[Verse 1:]
I really hate you
Stop getting in my way
I lost my patience
When are you gonna decay
I want to throw you out
Just like my broken TV
If you'll come back once more
It shall be painful you'll see

[Chorus:]
I hope you die in a fire
Hope you'll be stabbed in the heart, hope you get shot and expire
Hope you'll be taken apart
Hope this is what you desire

[Verse 2:]
It's almost over
Why can't you just let it fly
Don't be afraid
It's not the first time you'll die
Your mechanical parts click
Sounds like when I broke your bones
Once I get my second chance,
I won't leave you alone

[Chorus:]
I hope you die in a fire
Hope you'll be stabbed in the heart, hope you get shot and expire
Hope you'll be taken apart

I hope you die in a fire
Hope you'll be stabbed in the heart, hope you get shot and expire
Hope you'll be taken apart
Hope this is what you desire

I hope you die in a fire
