Ever on and on I continue circling
With nothing but my hate in a carousel of agony
Till slowly I forget and my heart starts vanishing
And suddenly I see that I can't break free--I'm
Slipping through the cracks of a dark eternity
With nothing but my pain and the paralyzing agony
To tell me who I am, who I was
Uncertainty enveloping my mind
Till I can't break free, and

Maybe it's a dream; maybe nothing else is real
But it wouldn't mean a thing if I told you how I feel
So I'm tired of all the pain, of the misery inside
And I wish that I could live feeling nothing but the
night
You can tell me what to say; you can tell me where to
go
But I doubt that I would care, and my heart would never
know
If I make another move,there'll be no more turning back
Because everything will change, and it all will fade to
black

Will tomorrow ever come? Will I make it through the
night?
Will there ever be a place for the broken in the light?
Am I hurting? Am I sad? Should I stay, or should I go?
I've forgotten how to tell. Did I ever even know?
Can I take another step? I've done everything I can
All the people that I see I will never understand
If I find a way to change, if I step into the light
Then I'll never be the same, and it all will fade to
white

Ever on and on I continue circling
With nothing but my hate in a carousel of agony
Till slowly I forget and my heart starts vanishing
And suddenly I see that I can't break free--I'm
Slipping through the cracks of a dark eternity
With nothing but my pain and the paralyzing agony
To tell me who I am, who I was
Uncertainty enveloping my mind
Till I can't break free, and

Maybe it's a dream; maybe nothing else is real
But it wouldn't mean a thing if I told you how I feel
So I'm tired of all the pain, of the misery inside
And I wish that I could live feeling nothing but the
night
You can tell me what to say; you can tell me where to
go
But I doubt that I would care, and my heart would never
know
If I make another move there'll be no more turning back
Because everything will change, and it all will fade to
black

If I make another move, if I take another step
Then it all would fall apart. There'd be nothing of me
left
If I'm crying in the wind, if I'm crying in the night
Will there ever be a way? Will my heart return to
white?
Can you tell me who you are? Can you tell me where I
am?
I've forgotten how to see; I've forgotten if I can
If I opened up my eyes there'd be no more going back,
Because I'd throw it all away, and it all would fade to
black

Awoken

[Verse 1]
What cause have I to feel glad?
I've built my life on judgment and causing pain.
I don't know those eyes I see in the bloodstained chrome
Now everything that I've had and everything I've known have been thrown away.
And with time I've come to find this isn't my home

[Chorus 1]
I've stroked the fire, seen more pain that you can know
The tears of the broken have washed away my soul
Pushed by desire to change the way my stream will flow
Now I've awoken, and I'm taking back control!

[Chorus 2]
I try my best to block out the screams.
But they're haunting me in my dreams
Please break my shackles,�?�I want it to stop

[Verse 2]
I man these wretched machines
Day in, day out, the grinding wears on my brain,
Undermining my sanity, making me question my reality,
But life is not as it seems
Should I take a chance of freedom and throw it all down the drain?
I've been imprisoned, please burn my transgressions away

[Chorus Part 1]
I've stroked the fire, seen more pain that you can know
The tears of the broken have washed away my soul
Pushed by desire to change the way my stream will flow
Now I've awoken, and I'm taking back control!

[Chorus 2]
I try my best to block out the screams.
But they're haunting me in my dreams
Please break my shackles,�?�I want it to stop

[Chorus 1]
I've stroked the fire, seen more pain that you can know
The tears of the broken have washed away my soul
Pushed by desire to change the way my stream will flow
Now I've awoken, and I'm taking back control!

[Chorus 1.5]
I'm sick of hurting, sick of thinking it's all I do,
I break those around me, those spared are very few,
But the, bright sun is burning, and my sky shines ever blue,
Friendships surround me, I'm becoming a part of you

[Chorus 2]
I try my best to block out the screams.
But they're haunting me in my dreams
Please break my shackles,�?�I want it to stop
