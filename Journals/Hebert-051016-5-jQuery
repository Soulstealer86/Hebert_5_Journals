What is jQuery good for?
Writing less code, while doing more, 
it's one of the high-level languages, 
so using it should be relatively easy.

Why jQuery and not just Javascript?
Hmm, I suppose it's because we need experience with more than just Javascript, 
so now we're using a high-level language to get a taste of what it's like.
